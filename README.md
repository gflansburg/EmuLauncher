# EmuLauncher
A simple tool for managing and launching all my emulators.

I had a need for giving my youngest a simple interface for launching old console emulators.  The emulators all have confusing names that, most of the time, don't
really describe the console it is emulating.  Yeah, sure, I could've just made a bunch of desktop links with custom icons and names, but I wanted sometime with
nice big buttons what were easy for him to recognize.

The application has the ability to launch with Windows and can minimize to the system tray.

Now, that being said, this app could be used for anything besides emulators.

Be sure to check out my DOSBox Manager application as well.  It is built upon the same idea as the Emu Launcher, but with a few more abilities, like editing the
config files.
